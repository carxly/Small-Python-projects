# Small-Python-projects
This is my collection of all the small Python projects I've done! I will log them all in this one repository.
The file names are numbered in order of creation.. for example '1' resembles my first ever project, '2' my second Python project,
and so on... I've done that for others and myself to see my progression and advancement towards more difficult projects.

Usually the Python file names will explain the project but if there's more explanation needed, then all the useful
information about the project will be the comments at the top of the file.

Hope these small projects will be helpful in any way!
